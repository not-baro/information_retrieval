1902,fyi gary sicks latest analysis on iran below posted on his blog sick has independent sources and is very well informed june 17 2009 is this another iranian revolution to someone who has watched and studied the iranian revolution of 1979 with fascination developments in iran today have an eerie reminiscence then there were massive protests that filled the streets often marching in dignified but ominous silence there was bloodshed as nervous security men with guns faced determined but unarmed crowds there were sullen mourning parades20there were catchy chants and ritual calls of down with the shah at night the rooftops rang with shouts of allahu akbar you need only change shah to dictator and you have description of what is happening in iran today but there is one very big difference thirty years ago iran had charismatic cleric named ayatollah khomeini who had refined sense of strategy and willingness to risk everything for the cause he represented on the other side was mohammed reza shah who had been on the throne for some 37 years and who commanded one of the most powerful military and security regimes in the world on the surface it appeared to be an uneven battle guns against turbans but the ruler with the guns wavered and the turbans grew in size and confidence until the old order collapsed today the nominal leader of the opposition forces is reformed radical mir hossein mousavi who is notably lacking in personal charisma on the other side is the constitutional leader ayatollah ichamene who is widely perceived as cautious political animal with limited qualifications for his religious post and who compensates for his own lack of charisma by manipulation of the political system and the institutions most loyal to him particularly the politically minded clergy and the powerful security forces including the revolutionary guards neither of these men seems to be fully in control of their own forces let alone the situation the fraudulent election defeat of mousavi was triggering event but the energy behind these unprecedented demonstrations is due more to the sense of outrage and betrayal at the gross manipulation of numbers by the regime than it is about any undying devotion to mousavi yesterday mousavi ordered that people stay home in face of conflicting proregime demonstration they marched anyway and the daughter of former president rafsanjani joined them and urged them on mousavi then ordered everyone to march the following day which they were probably going to do with or without his orders ichamenei announced the divine assessment of the election outcome even before it would probably have been physically possible to count the more than 40 million ballots then in the face of mass protests he ordered an investigation of the results by the guardian council the same organization that was responsible for managing the election in the first place no one believed him in either case and no one expected anything of importance from the guardian council khamenei has ordered peace and reconciliation no one paid any attention deliberately did not mention presidentelect ahmadinejad after,0.6368750929832458

2088,dear secretary clinton hope that your elbow is healing quickly mentioned that we were doing some work on maritime developments in the region from the persian gulf to the east china sea and sea of japan below are key findings from the report but the main takeaway is that the political impact of chinese military modernization may be greater than narrow technical analysis of chinas capabilities would suggest and for range of reasons technical and political prospects for regional cooperation are limited but pathways to conflict are numerous and increasing all best jackie key findings from the workshop include chinese naval modernization has proceeded at rates higher than forecast 10 years ago and has created the capability to complicate operation of us carrier battle groups within 1000 kilometers of the chinese coastline the indian ocean may in the coming decades be the operating area of ssbns from countries with limited experience in sustained ssbn patrols including india china and possibly pakistan chinese maritime relations with countries along the littoral area have continued to develop with new friendly relationship emerging with sri lanka to complement the existing relations with myanmar and pakistan this may lead to new form of bluebrown water naval operations in which chinese naval forces operate far from chinese bases but close to the coasts of client states the workshop tended to the conclusion that the trends in the region were not such as to make maritime cooperation easy these trends include japanese concern that chinese dominance in the waters within 1000 miles of chinese territory has immediate consequences for japans maritime autonomy indian suspicion of chinese naval developments in hainan island chinese development of port infrastructure in pakistan and myanmar and the possibility of chinese ballistic missile submarines operating close to india indian interest in ssbns plus chinese ssbn ports in hainan and even possibly pakistani ssbns all of which creates the possibility of multiple ssbn patrols in the indian ocean along with the potential for naval nuclear accidents at sea asymmetries in levels of operational competence and technology in submarines and maritime aviation which for example make functional multinational naval cooperation harder for states that are afraid of revealing technologies or weaknesses the major role of landbased maritime warfare strike complexes in this region which means that war at sea always carries with it the risk of escalation to strikes on ground targets in homeland areas the report also offers two scenarios under which the united states may consider engaging militarily in the region the first scenario which concerns clash between japan and china in waters claimed by both compels us to consider the circumstances under which the chinese may seek to demonstrate that their new maritime capabilities must be taken seriously and respected and what the united states would lose if it did not support the japanese and then faced world in which japan became either subordinate power to china or nuclear armed state capable of pursuing its national interest independent of the united states the second scenario concerns an american naval blockade of an iran that,0.6735122203826904
2088,has tested nuclear weapon potentially giving rise to an interaction between the united states and china far from the operating bases of each but close to territory of client of china bluebrown water clash in this scenario china is using its navy to show presence and to force the united states to ask itself whether it wants to go to war with china over political conflict that is less than black and white thinking about the options that would be left to the united states under these circumstances underscores how chinese naval forces may have more political impact by 2025 than narrow assessment of their military capabilities would suggest on fri may 22 2009 at newmyer wrote secretary clinton the australian is the newspaper in which read your remarks on asiapacific thank you again jackie sent from my verizon wireless blackberry,0.5840096473693848

2141,secretary clinton thank you will update you when hear from her and if there is anything else should do let me know all best jackie ps saw that foreign minister yeo was on your schedule today fyi he is one of my favorite singaporeans because of this 2007 speech on china which he posted to his blog april 12 2007 foreign minister george yeos speech at dinner organised by the lee kuan yew school of public policy on 5 february 2007 which he gave offthecuff thank you kishore for your kind words dear friends ladies and gentlemen was in india two weeks ago had good trip spent nine days there while in calcutta after calling on the chief minister had bit of time to look around so attended mass at mother theresas house very interesting gathering there was singapore nun there she had been there for over ten years sister maria tony wondered why someone from singapore would want to dedicate her life to picking up the dead and the dying in the back alleys of calcutta and living that life there were many nuns there who were in their ninth year they take their first vow in the fifth year renewable every year in the tenth year they have to decide final vows for eternity so if you are not sure please theres way out if you are sure then youre in the room so the priest gave very tough sermon and while he was talking could hear the din of traffic noise outside in the streets of calcutta then suddenly heard the call of the muezzin now this is hindu city told myself thought wow what diversity in this country india and its ability to internalise this diversity and to find it unremarkable that the tiny woman from albania should come into their midst become one of them and then when she was beatified was celebrated as an indian on the way to canonization china and india in that comparison china is not india china has very different sense of itself its deep internal construction is very different superficially there are similarities as there is between china and the us and china and europe but if you look into its deep construction it is very different when we talk about chinas future and china in the 21st century how china will behave in world community chinas attitudes towards democracy towards law towards social justice it is important first to look into this deep construction because that is their nature naturally we should not be deterministic there is nothing inevitable in human history but when we understand its nature it becomes easier to anticipate its moves and youll be less suprised by its actions few years ago the chinese government embarked on major project which is its dynastic duty to write the history of the qing dynasty the manchus from 1368 to 1644 ever since the han dynasty roughly contemporaneous with the roman empire they developed historiographic tradition of each dynasty writing the history of the previous period so sima qian,0.9674889445304871
2141,of the later han wrote of the earlier han and the entire period before that then later on they wrote about the later han jin wrote up the three kingdoms ming wrote up the yuan the yuan which was mongol in its origins wrote up the sung sung wrote up the tang dynasty which was the classical period the last dynasty the qing collapsed in the republican revolution of 1911 this is now 2007 think in 2003 they embarked on this project the official history of the qing dynasty when the former vice premier li lanqing was in singapore recently asked him about it he said we told the scholars not to rush this project asked him how long it would take to write this history he said it would take many years easily 10 years said have you collected the material he said yes asked external sources he said yes external sources too all the countries the vatican european countries the whole lot all assembled 24 official histories this would be the 26th and lis instruction to them was not to be too quick to draw conclusions now mao tze tung was revolutionary he was great revolutionary he overturned everything before but he knew his history he read the 24 histories and not only did he read them he annotated them but he wrote with terrible illegible scrawl so scholars had to decipher those scrawls then they wrote commentaries on his commentaries and now its all published it is very difficult for the chinese to depart from their own history because its the same great plains the same mountains more or less the same neighbours more or less and they have seen the same patterns recur so long time ago during the ming dynasty they wrote up the romantic period of the three kingdoms the first line said below heaven great movements great currents long disunity leads to unity and long unity leads to disunity so they accept as part of their own deep nature that there are cycles in their civilisation that they have ups and downs in recent years when you visit them you could sense them feeling their own reemergence its bit scary in the initial years they were lacking in confidence they asked many questions but now they know that there is an organic vitality it is like an adolescent who watches his own development and conscious of it say scary because for those of us who live on the periphery of that empire what happens there will radiate its influence on us and eventually to greater or lesser degree envelope us how do we see china think to begin with its important not to try and from an intellectual viewpoint transpose our own experiences on to china because believe it will develop according to its own logic according to its own dna it is growing now it will continue to grow it will develop its own contradictions and one day those contradictions many years from now will lead to its own decline so they say at,0.9787822365760803
2141,the beginning of dynasty the taxes are light but the treasury is full and at the end of dynasty the taxes are crushing but the treasury is empty the important thing to realise about china is that some things are deeply resistant to change take confucius every time they had to overturn dynasty they had to overturn confucius because confucius justified the status quo so throughout the 19th century whether it was the taiping revolution the communist movement or sun yat sen they spent their lives debunking confucius it reached its final moment when they criticised zhou enlai together with confucius no lin biao together with confucius that was the last paroxysm today hu jingtao said in mandarin he xie she hui harmonious society suddenly you hear the resonance of confucius coming back and everywhere in the world on the pattern of alliance francaise the goethe institute the usia they establish confucius institutes and the learning of the confucianist classics are coming back with remarkable force in china not yet in the state curriculum but just parents wanting to teach their children the confucianist ditties now why is this important from mao to deng to jiang zemin at every stage they reinterpreted marx they are comfortable with the young marx the idea of the superstructure on the economic base the idea that politics is concentrated economics that they like but the class struggle they downplay they talk about the three represents the progressive forces the progressive elements they nurture those now hu jingtao says harmonious society peaceful reemergence this mindset has certain attitude towards law has certain attitude towards religion towards democracy and towards foreign policy and would like to deal with each in turn joseph needham many years ago think in the 60s the man who wrote the science and civilisation of china that great encyclopedic work he said its not that the chinese have no legal tradition in fact by his estimation the chinese had greater corpus of legal codification than the west greater corpus of legal codification than the west surprise surprise but the idea that the emperor is below the law that is completely alien to their thinking where did that idea come from well in the west you may trace it back to hammurabi you may trace it back to moses to greece to rome but if you trace the evolution of that dna it goes back way back into its early beginnings the chinese had very different evolutionary starting point it was not in law it was in an idea they call 1i which is proper conduct among human beings they believe deep in their instincts that law is only means towards justice and that when the outcome of law is perverse then that law must be overridden because justice proper conduct the proper relationship among human beings must take precedence and to suddenly say that all that had happened in the previous dynasties all that the earlier histories have summarised are all wrong and that they should instead adopt something with its origins in western,0.7715398669242859
2141,will yet christianise china so if you read the despatches of the missionaries during that period the tartar wars they described it they were full of hope but not chance they appealed to the second emperor kangxi can we send more missionaries no problem can we have them all report to papal legate in beijing no such thing the emperor imposed one condition you can send as many priests as you want to china but they must die in china they cannot leave after that you see instinctively the chinese when they see the catholic church they see someone like themselves someone whose claim to its members is total and for whom that loyalty is jealous one mind you they do not try to control everything they just control the big things dogma doctrine after that you are left on your own and you are financially independent but on the big issue of who appoints ministers and provincial secretaries its the same as the pope appointing bishops and bishops ordaining priests and governing this vast empire whether were talking about the chinese empire or the catholic empire they have about the same number of members in the world which is why their interaction is complex and difficult one and over the appointment of bishops both seek ultimate authority in the end they have got to find way to resolve it can anticipate the vaticans argument that we are not of this realm we are of the other realm so please we are not in conflict as for the chinese leaders their attitude towards religion from the earliest days is to keep religion at arms length those who govern the empire they are areligious they can have private religions but in matters of their public conduct they are confucianist in public you are not catholic you are not muslim you are not buddhist when the jesuits went to china they were very impressed by this that it was possible to create moral order based not on religion but on ethics so impressed that they wrote about it and influenced people like voltaire and the other encyclopedists it helped inspire the frence revolution that you could get rid of the church and still maintain moral order in society ive talked about china and law china and democracy china and religion now let me talk about china and foreign policy which is perhaps your greatest interest about which can only talk about generally because you are the experts in this field think its very difficult for the chinese to break from their old mindset that they are zhong guo the middle kingdom they are at the center of the universe then there are the other chopsticks peoples who are semisinic think they consider singapore to be semisinic then there are those who are beyond that realm who are what the greeks would have called barbarians the mongols the manchus the europeans the americans the indians and so on now all that jargon of course is not in use today they are very civilised they will,0.9650496244430542
2141,itself they will also be reacting to us if they find the world threatening place they will develop their own responses to those threats quite early in the day they wanted to neutralise southeast asia asean it had never been an area which threatened them historically so they didnt worry about southeast asia as threat but resources sea lanes they go through southeast asia and they made dramatic move few years ago zhu rongji was here for the aseanchina summit he said free trade agreement at that time when he announced it the leaders of asean almost fell off their chairs we thought of china an economic threat to us not as partner took us almost year to digest the implications and to say yes lets negotiate step by step and all the time china was assuring us that we would benefit more than they would benefit when the framework agreement was signed by zhu rongji in 2002 in phonm penh he made two remarkable statements he said if after 10 years the agreement benefits china more than it benefits southeast asia let us renegotiate it can never imagine the american ustr or the european trade commissioner talking like that mean in contract deal is deal its settled for eternity then he said china does not seek for itself an exclusive position in southeast asia so he acknowledged that we were not just going to date one girl we intended to be promiscuous from the beginning towards northeast asia think it is very complicated because there is so much history and legacy towards central asia towards russia they have deep fears towards america it has become relationship bound together at so many points rupture would become more and more unthinkable but it is going to be very difficult relationship it will be the most important and most difficult relationship to manage in this century if its badly managed there will be war if its properly managed there will be another generation of peace and hundreds of millions of people in the world would be raised out of the depths of poverty in this area you are the experts but whenever see china and watch its moves go back to its deep nature because its not easy for country so vast with such sense of itself to depart too much from its deep nature thank you george yeo on mon apr 27 2009 at wrote michele look forward to getting together to discuss number of issues thanks for following up jackie newmyer her email all the best hillary jacqueline newmyer president long term strategy group 12 eliot st cambridge ma 02138 6176611626 fax wwwltstrategycom,0.9835811853408813

2463,hrc back this morning from asia congratulations on the speech think it came out great and the reaction have heard today has been very positive let raise an idea about how you could present the arrangement on settlements that you are seeking with israel as understand it ie moratorium coupled with allowances to complete number of housing units there are two ways 1 to describe it as an agreement explaining why the us has accepted an israeli completion of handful of units whose construction already has begun this raises some concerns it would represent us legitimization of some however small israeli activity in the west bank and it would trigger arab and palestinian complaints that we had compromised sowing doubts about our effectiveness 2 the alternative would be for the administration to say we have come very long way as israel has made unprecedented commitments to the us in terms of settlements freeze this is very welcome development we did not achieve all that we had hoped as israel intends to complete number of housing units we have differences with the israeli government on this matter which we have expressed to them that said we are convinced that substantial progress has been made that warrants an immediate resumption of peace talks as well as arab steps toward israel that will help promote twostate solution this latter option retains our credibility does not compromise our oftstated position and allows us to move forward of course am around if you want to discuss good luck in india they are very excited about your visit sandy,0.9292517304420471

2525,whenever you do something big on tv we all hear from lots of folks saying you did great but this time is noticeably different first people across the spectrum dc insiders reporters staff exstaff friends of friends wh folks etc were blown away second people were really moved by the last segment three people even told me they teared up im guessing and hoping you hear this directly from random folks in the coming days and think because its been lousy couple of weeks for the admin with mixed messages and bad news coupled with many people seeing you for the first time for an extended period talking about the job and your relationship with the president and that combo was probably the most powerful reminder since your speech in denver that youre in class all your own including the president who became enmeshed in the gates incident that you didnt wait for the envoy question was key you turned it into strength what you said about the president and how you said it one cant help but think how much of team player you are and how remarkably youve adapted to the role you were definitely on your game you either threw perfect game or at least no hitter so this couldnt have gone better achieved everything we needed to times 10 and comes on the heels of great 10 days will be interesting to see the storyline that emanates from this because there was no substantive news itll be focus on style especially saving biden,0.9975589513778687

2550,pvervee secretary clinton understand you are going to kenya next week and while know the trip is primarily focused on trade issues wanted to flag an issue for you because know it is near and dear to your heart kenya has one of the strictest antiabortion laws in africa it is illegal unless womans life is at risk and criminalizes both the woman and the provider two years ago kenyan authorities imprisoned doctor and two nurses falsely accusing them of providing illegal abortions after year in prison the providers were found innocent and released but it galvanized the legal and provider community who formed coalition to make abortion less restrictive it will come as no surprise to you that as result of their abortion law kenya has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of africa with an estimated 800 women day seeking the procedure often through dangerous means kenya is restarting longstalled constitutional review process and they hope to produce final constitution by next year religious groups are on concerted crusade to include new language in the constitution which would codify that life begins at conception the current constitution is largely silent on the issue if this fetal personhood amendment goes forward it would place kenya in the small community of nations with such provision it would clearly mark kenya as out of stop with countries attempting to institutionalize the african unions maputo protocol one of the most progressive regional documents on women development and reproductive rights and with the vast majority of african countries in general for country trying to regain the momentum of stability and success it enjoyed until recently such policy imposition would be regression for womens rights and for the country writ large went to kenya last month to work with the coalition that has formed to strategize against the constitutional amendment and to work toward less restrictive abortion law also visited several of our clinics and providers in nairobi and in nearby villages where planned parenthood has programs to train providers in post abortion care you have seen this million times in your travels around the world so dont need to tell you how poignant the stories were of the lives saved and lost the bravery in standing up to constant government harassment and the fear of what this potential constitutional amendment will mean to the provision of safe medical services know it is asking lot but if there is any way that you could draw attention to this issue when you are in kenya you would be even more of my personal hero than you already are it is our hope that if kenya knows the world is watching they may be more careful in how they proceed of course we would be happy to help you in any way if you decide you want to do something on this while you are there there is also congressional delegation going to kenya the week of august 8th and we are working on them to have side meeting on this issue as well as,0.9153978824615479

2626,anything it takes to get there and im not going to let anything stand in my way he must have thought getting to heaven was just another power play and power plays are the key to right wing psychology right wing psychology is the other thing that blumenthal has to offer at the periphery of this world is your runofthemill bully man like jack abramoff whose brutality is well remembered by his high school classmates but who sang like bird once he was caught at the center of is james dobson much more destructive figure than abramoff who advocates in the strongest terms child beating and not only childbeating but dogbeating at one point he brags about going after the family canine who weighed twelve pounds and engaging in the most vicious fight ever staged between man and beast as for children the goal is to keep beating the child until he wantss to crumple on the breast of his parent in other words dobson is proud sadist who thinks sadism is kind of funny and who over the years has successfully advocated sadism as the only workable form of childrearing it order to understand the deeply disturbing effect dobson and his theories have had on our culture blumenthal cites erich fromms escape from freedom about the psychology of nazism and authoritarianism and eric hoffers the true believer insofar as he finds the documentation blumenthal points out how many of these powerful evangelical christians were beaten and abused as children including dobson its high number the beatings often arbitrary cruel and frequent were then in many cases backed up with constant lessons about godthat he is arbitrary that he is cruel that he demands obedience above all things and that he surpasseth understanding the point of these exercises is to establish the powerlessness of the child his shame and guilt as worthless sinner and his absolute fear of thinking for himself he will then take his place in the hierarchy and thereby reinforce the existence of the hierarchy blumenthal goes pretty far with this psychology but in my view not far enough im sure he was reared by liberal parents who gave him sense of responsibility curiosity and autonomy and since he is only in his thirties dont think that he really empathizes with the tortured and damaged souls that he has been interviewing and watching for the last few years dont think he understands their fearhow deep it is how constant it is and how arousing it is dont think in fact that max blumenthal looks within and sees evil think he looks within and says im okay youre okay thats the goal of liberal parenting and as we can tell by statistics he cites concerning unwed pregnancy divorce and occurrence of stds liberal parenting works atheists and agnostics for example have much lower rate of divorce than evangelicals and states that have sex education in the schools rather than abstinenceonly education have lower rates of teen pregnancy but child who is beaten enough eventually comes to understand two things above,0.6171728372573853

2975,magazine the power grid back from the death panel how the public option helped by congressman looking for an issue and shrewdly silent white house returned from the brink published oct 11 2009 on the night last week when much of washington was joyously weeping over the seal of approval bestowed on the baucus healthcare bill by the congressional budget office anthony weiner was in his quarters in the rayburn building merrily pissing all over the legislation instead its just too weak he told me it doesnt do enough it doesnt achieve real cost savings theres no real competition its pretty much wish list for the insurance companies and those were merely weiners substantive criticisms of the bill his political assessment was even harsher its effectively dead he said not droplet of weiners dismissal of the baucus plan came as any sort of shock hes been trashing the senate finance committees efforts for weeks whats surprising is that anyone gives fig what weiner has to say about the topic in the first place until six months ago after all the congressman was known more for his yearning to acquire the keys to gracie mansion than his mastery of the arcana of medicare reimbursement rates in fact as weiner would be the first to admit his interest in knowledge of and record on healthcare reform were perilously close to nonexistent and yet since may when he concluded that taking on mike bloomberg was challenge that went beyond the sisyphean into the realm of the just plain silly weiner has emerged as one of the few real stars in the marathon healthcare debate the clearest and savviest and as always loudest and noodgiest voice in favor of the public option and though its plain that whatever bill eventually lands on barack obamas deskand yes think the odds are now close to overwhelming that big pile of healthcare paper will wind up therewont be anything close to weiners singlepayer dream his role in framing the terms of the discussion has been more than salutary in some nonobvious ways you could argue that its been essential should confess at the outset that have longstanding soft spot for weiner whom first met more than twenty years ago when he was budding chuck schumer protégé and we played on the same capitol hill softball team weiner then was strikingly similar to weiner now ampedup ambitious wicked smart forever gauging all the angles unafraid of being actually proud of being royal pain in the tuchis all the qualities in other words that have served him so well in the wrangle over health care weiner describes his efflorescence on the subject as matter of opportunism in the best sense of the word this was one of those unusual issues where we really didnt have mother ship that was directing the message and that created an entrepreneurial environment he says you didnt have the president out there speaking clearly about what he wanted and among my colleagues there werent people that jumped out who either had comfort with the material or,0.6023644208908081

3091,counseling that helps the dying live by devin talbott and strobe talbott saturday august 29 2009 many opponents of healthcare reform have concentrated their fire on provision in house legislation that would provide for government reimbursement to doctors who offer endoflife counseling how our society deals with those confronting death is understandably controversial unfortunately the debate has degenerated into cacophony of demagoguery and distortion including invocations of hitler and fearmongering about death panels as result of these attacks number of senators who are key to determining what bill will emerge from congress have abandoned support for endoflife counseling our familys experience this year provided vivid perspective on the value of that service and the misguidedness of the campaign against it brooke shearer wife mother and grandmother had been fighting cancer for more than year she had undergone major surgery numerous scans and biopsies and two debilitating courses of chemotherapy her doctors were among the best in their fields their expertise did not however extend to the fine points of and latest advances in pain management brooke was determined to maintain the highest possible quality of her own life and that of her family for whatever time we had together with that goal in mind she sought advice and treatment from palliativecare specialists at washington home and community hospices their ingenuity and skill in adjusting her medications significantly alleviated her discomfort in her final months working closely with her primary physicians the hospice staff helped brooke anticipate the likely course of her disease in way that allowed her to make decisions and exercise degree of control over both her own condition and our familys adjustment to it when her oncologist concluded that chemotherapy was not working brooke put herself fully into the hands of washington home as an outpatient regular house calls by hospice doctors nurses and social workers enabled her to stay active on professional projects spend time with friends and family and end her life at home which was considerable comfort to her and to us these not issues of cost were the principal considerations for our family however controlling the cost of health care especially in the last year of life is an important part of the current national debate therefore it is worth noting that brookes treatment in the last stages of her illness was far less expensive than it had been in the previous year it has often been said that dying can be fulltime job that was emphatically not the case with brooke until her final days she concentrated on living choice that endoflife counseling helped make possible hospice care more than meets the standard of the hippocratic oath it not only does no harm it does good it is not about hastening death but enhancing life if counseling about hospice services and palliative care is beneficiary of health care reform many americans will be as well devin talbott along with his brother adrian is cofounder of generationengage strobe talbott is president of the brookings institution strobe talbott president the brookings institution 1775 massachusetts avenue nw washington,0.9659915566444397

3263,coalition and its not pretty one for democrats the historical base of the democratic party for two centuries has long been what jay cost and call jacksonians culturally conservative hawkish and populist whites located throughout the south and border states they began breaking away from democrats in the 1950s and 1960s their reaction to the partys embrace of unions blacks and liberals is story is so well known theres no need to rehash it here but this group remained at least in play for the democrats clinton inherited coalition consisting of minorities liberals urban voters and decent remnant of jacksonian voters in the ohio river valley and the south who still preferred moderatetoconservative democrat to republican this coalition became majority coalition when clinton used combination of fiscal conservatism and social moderation to bring suburban voters on board this was huge innovation for democrats suburbs like nassau county ny orange county ca and fairfax county va had fueled the rise of the republican parties in those states clinton moved them substantially toward his side this coalition allowed him to win by eight points in 1996 absent perot and lastminute fundraising scandal he probably would have won by more clinton intuited that suburban voters are generally speaking culturally cosmopolitan they dont like it when you call someone macaca and arent crazy about the religious right but theyre generally not particularly socially liberal either and are fans of law and order they like taxes low and appreciate economic growth but like good schools and clean environment having to balance bunch of spending priorities with somewhat limited income in their daily lives balanced budgets are the ultimate good government indicator for these voters clinton delivered on all of these issues keeping tax increases fairly small and balancing the budget for much of his term in so doing and this is very important he rebranded the democrats as the party of fiscal responsibility economic growth moderate taxes and smart government in other words he finally shed the carter label for the democrats this in turn made it plausible for his much more liberal heirs to benefit from this presumption of competence for democrats one that they probably would not have enjoyed without him george bushs presidency in turn was an uppermiddle class suburbanites nightmare an aggressive social agenda fiscal trainwreck two poorlymanaged wars and financial collapse later these suburban voters trended even more heavily democratic then they were in the clinton era by 2008 democrats held most of the suburban districts around major metropolitan areas and were threatening in the exurbs the right democratic candidate probably could have put together massive 2008 presidential majority combining minorities liberals jacksonians catholics and suburbanites the mood of the country was certainly right for 1920193219521980 result but the democrats nominated barack obama the partys grip among jacksonians had weakened since clinton left the stage but they abandoned obama completely jay cost and have detailed this here this movement is why obama received 53 of the vote instead of the 60 or so we might expect given the voters attitude toward bushs,0.6266546845436096

3604,levin opposed the surge but voted for funding the troops pasted below is levins speech on troops in afghanistan well have copy for you as well afghan speech below for immediate release september 11 2009 contact senator levins office phone 2022246221 senate floor speech surge the afghan army remarks as prepared for delivery today we mark solemn anniversary eight years ago this morning our nation was attacked by terrorist extremists motivated by hatred and bent on destruction it is always appropriate to remember the shock of that day the innocent lives lost and the efforts our nation has made since that day to ensure that afghanistan the nation that hosted those terrorists cannot again become safe haven for terrorists seeking to attack us but today is an especially appropriate occasion to take stock of those efforts and consider how best to continue them recently returned from trip to afghanistan where was joined by my colleagues senators jack reed and ted kaufman the situation in afghanistan is serious security has deteriorated but if we take the right steps we can ensure that afghanistan does not revert to talibanfriendly government that could once again provide safe haven for al qaeda to terrorize us and the world the obama administrations new strategy focusing on securing the afghan populations safety and partnering with the afghan security forces in that effort is an important start at reversing the situation in afghanistan the change in strategy has led our forces in the words of general mcchrystals counterinsurgency guidance to live eat and train together with the afghan security forces plan and operate together depend on one another and hold each other accountableand treat them as equal partners in success the guidance goes on to say that the success of the afghan security forces is our goal to achieve that goal we should increase and accelerate our efforts to support the afghan security forces in their efforts to become selfsufficient in delivering security to their nation before we consider whether to increase us combat forces above the levels already planned for the next few months these steps include increasing the size of the afghan army and police much faster than presently planned providing more trainers for the afghan army and police than presently planned providing them more equipment than presently planned and working to separate local taliban fighters from their leaders and attract them to the side of the government as we did in iraq while the security situation in afghanistan has worsened we still have important advantages there the afghan people hate the taliban public opinion polls show support for the taliban at about 5 in addition the afghan army is highly motivated and its troops are proven fighters despite those advantages we face significant challenges general mcchrystal believes and agree that we need to regain the initiative and create momentum towards success general mcchrystal worries and rightly so about the perception that we have lost that initiative and the impact of that perception on the afghan people their government al qaeda and the taliban by contrast if,0.9898627996444702
3604,we can dispel that perception we have chance to convince local and lower level taliban fighters to lay down their arms and rejoin afghan society believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in afghanistan is with series of steps to ensure that afghanistans army and police have the manpower equipment and support to secure their own nation first we should increase troop levels for the afghan army and police faster than currently planned there are approximately 90000 troops in the afghan army now and that number is scheduled to go up to 134000 by october of 2010 the afghan police are scheduled to reach level of 82000 by the same time for long time many of us have urged the establishment of goal of 240000 afghan troops and 160000 afghan police by 2013 the afghan minister of defense has strongly supported those numbers it now appears that our government and the afghan government are prepared to accept those goals but the need for additional afghan forces is urgent believe it both possible and essential to advance those goals by year to 2012 our own military in afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to need for more afghan forces in one sector of helmand province we visited last week our marines outnumbered afghan soldiers by 5 to one marine company commander in helmand province told the new york times in july that lack of afghan troops is absolutely our achilles heel what do we need to do to increase the size of the afghan army and police according to afghan defense minister wardak there is no lack of afghan manpower weve been assured it is available but we will need significantly more trainers we asked general formica who is in charge of the american effort to train afghan security forces whether such an increase is possible he indicated he would make an assessment of what would be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable in the meantime we should also press our nato allies with much greater forcefulness to provide more trainers if our nato allies are not going to come through with the combat forces they have pledged at least they could provide additional trainers larger afghan security forces will also require more midlevel afghan officers in addition to supporting efforts to graduate more afghan officers from army academies we should consider the recommendation of defense minister wardak that previous midlevel officers who fought the war against the soviets return to service on an interim basis minister wardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated and while they may not be trained in the most current tactics they nonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while the new group of officers is trained larger afghan force will need supporting infrastructure such barracks while the available infrastructure may not be the most modern it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts larger afghan security forces will require additional equipment there must be major effort to transfer significant amount of the equipment that is coming out of,0.6920280456542969
3604,iraq to the afghan army and police such significant commitment to equip the afghan security forces would also help demonstrate us determination to take the initiative and create momentum in the right direction there is an enormous amount of equipment coming out of iraq our military is calling it one of the greatest transfers of military goods in the worlds history significant part of it could be transferred to the afghan forces increasing their capability without weakening our own readiness and yet there does not seem to be that kind of crash effort in place to do that we need to obtain on an urgent basis list of the basic equipment needs of the afghan forces and list of how those needs could be met in major program to transfer equipment leaving iraq rapidly expanding afghanistans military and police forces would address one of the major problems and risks we now face there general mcchrystal told us he worries that waiting until 2013 for larger afghan force creates gap in capabilities that brings significant risk of failure but by accelerating the training and equipping of afghan forces by year we address his concern depending on additional capability from afghan rather than us forces also addresses major problem of public perception in afghanistan the larger our own military footprint there the more our enemies can seek to drive wedge between us and the afghan population spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate muslim nation finally we should make concerted effort to separate the local taliban from their leaders in iraq large numbers of young iraqis who had been attacking us switched over to our side and became the sons of iraq they were drawn in part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for past attacks and in part by the recognition that the status quo was creating horrific violence in their own communities in their own interests and the interests of their nation they switched sides and became positive force that same prospect exists in afghanistan afghan leaders and our military say that local taliban fighters are motivated largely by the need for job or loyalty to the local leader who pays them and not by ideology or religious zeal they believe an effort to attract these fighters to the governments side could succeed if they are offered security for themselves and their families and if there is no penalty for previous activity against us general mcchrystal himself has emphasized the potential of such reintegration to accomplish the same result as was achieved in iraq here is what general mcchrystal said on july 28th most of the fighters we see in afghanistan are afghans some with foreign cadre with them but most we dont see are deeply ideological or even politically motivated most are operating for pay some are under commanders charismatic leadership some are frustrated with local leaders so believe there is significant potential to go after what would call mid and lowlevel taliban fighters and leaders and offer them reintegration into afghanistan under the constitution but this game changing,0.543594241142273
3604,possibility was apparently not factored into general mcchrystals assessment there is no plan yet to put in place sons of iraq approach in afghanistan it is urgent that we lay out the steps that need to be taken to involve local and national afghan leaders in that effort they alone can accomplish this crucial job but first we and our afghan allies must draft such plan on an urgent basis and the potential positive impact of such plan should be taken into account as we consider the need for any additional us military resources afghanistans people are grateful for our aid but also eager to assume responsibility for their future in tiny village in helmand province we were invited to meet with the village elders at their council meeting their shura one hundred or so men sat on the floor and chatted with us about their future and their countrys future when asked how long the united states should stay one elder said until the moment that you make our security forces selfsufficient then you will be welcome to visit us not as soldiers but as guests helping afghanistan achieve selfsufficiency in their security is everybodys goal on that there is little difference of opinion in afghanistans village councils or in the corridors of this capitol can we help afghanistan reach selfsufficiency in security fast enough can we get there in way that regains the initiative and creates the momentum we need can we encourage those lower level taliban to abandon an insurgency headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they dont share believe we can by supporting far more rapid growth in the afghan army and police by providing more trainers more quickly by rapid infusion to afghan units of equipment no longer needed in iraq and by rapidly adopting plan for the reintegration of lower level taliban fighters into afghan society in other words we need surge of afghan security forces our support of their surge will show our commitment to the success of mission that is clearly in our national security interest without creating bigger us military footprint that provides propaganda fodder for the taliban believe that taking those steps on an urgent basis while completing the previously planned and announced increase in us combat forces provides the best chance of success for our mission preventing afghanistan from again being run by taliban government which harbors and supports alqaeda whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic attacks on the united states and the world and we should implement these steps before considering an increase in us ground combat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of this year,0.7973682880401611

3715,heres the update pieced together from various sources starting at around 3 pm friday adams and mcguinness returned to hillsborogh to meet with robinson and arlene foster the four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review the discussion continued until around 1 am when the parties left hillsborough fosters presence is apparently very helpful her relationship with the sf leaders is much more positive and direct treating them as equal colleagues woodward and irish fm martin will meet with adams and robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks are the talks last nightearly morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be decision to push on today to see if agreement can be reached it is equally possible that the two ministers and dupsf will decide to wind up today and resume on monday brown and cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon the issue is still parades robinson needs some certainity of change on parades it is important for him politically within the dup but also externally since this has become symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too much adams and sf have moved very far from their original positions on parades adding that robinson has also moved the dup linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not robinsons goal but dup deputy party leader nigal dodds logistically such linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework requires consultation legislation and implementation the role of justice minister and hisher relationship to the executive has been agreed other issues such as irish language act ns bodies etc while symbolic and emotive for sf and the nationalists community can be dealt with,0.7522484660148621

3968,on afghanistan that the general might not have liked petraeus offered cryptic rather than clear response see above video at the first draft of history meeting sponsored by the atlantic monthlyatlantic media group the newseum and the aspen institute petraeus when asked if he would support the president no matter what the result of the strategic review on afghanistan responded that he would continue to give the president the best professional military advice he could contrast that with defense secretary robert gates resoonoinato_thesaestipr we will salute and execute the presidents decisions faithfully and to the best of our ability but after spending an evening with general petraeus and watching him closely for number of years there is no way that this intelligent leader with whom have some disagreements but respect could be comfortable with the tea party takeover of the republican political machine there is always the possibility that core of reasonable republicans like michael bloomberg james baker olympia snowe chuck hegel alan simpson john whitehead peter peterson rita hauser and others will try to rekindle classic republican sensibilities by fighting to rehijack their party back in an eisenhowerlike campaign with petraeus at the lead remember that eisenhower clinched the republican nomination by promising to be the president who though he knew war would end the korean war petraeus knows afghanistan and iraq and though it seems hard to envision today could be the kind of leader promising to end those wars if obama proves unable to do so but there is another option that intrigues me and seems more realistic than imagining the iconic david petraeus running for president and that is his running for vice president think vice president joe biden has done an outstanding job and of all the big guns in the obama white house biden has done the best job of outperforming expectations he had given president obama much needed counsel not always taken regrettably but counsel that obama needed to show the american public he was getting biden has been the key agent behind the scenes in moving iraqs elections forward he has scored lot of wins not reported in the nuclearwmd controls arena biden has worked with gates in stabilizing an awkward and complex relationship with russia and his counterpoints on the afghanistan surge in my view remain compelling but biden is going to have to find way to hold his spot in 2012 because others are going to be gunning for it as look at it now hillary clinton who has now said that she will not do more than one term as secretary of state would be natural candidate for the obama vp slot her franchise is not completely in the control of the obama team yet but moving hillary closer to the white house although her private home on whitehaven street is actually couple of hundred feet closer to the white house than the vp residence at the naval observatory would finalize obarnas takeover of all the key political franchises in the democratic party starting with daleys machine deschles machine kennedys machine,0.9767111539840698

4079,northern ireland agrees powersharing deal gordon brown hails historic deal which will see justice and policing powers be devolved to stormont from 12 april henry mcdonald quardiancouk friday 5 february 2010 1142 gmt gordon brown the dup leader peter robinson and sinn feins martin mcguinness to talk to the press after the northern ireland powersharing deal was announced photograph julien behalpa justice and policing powers will be devolved to northern irelands powersharing government from 12 april in historic deal agreed by the main parties that opens new chapter after decades of violence gordon brown said today standing alongside his irish counterpart brian cowen at press conference at hillsborough castle outside belfast the prime minister said the inspirational agreement between sinn fein and the democratic unionist party dup was foundation for lasting peace the deal finally agreed to by the dup last night and described as final piece in the jigsaw after long search for peace comes after two weeks of roundtheclock negotiations and brings an end to fears that the powersharing government might collapse it will see policing and justice powers devolved from westminster to the assembly within weeks and includes new plans on overseeing parades brown who travelled to belfast this morning said the agreement had been possible because of new spirit of mutual co operation and respect the deal meets key sinn fein demand and prevents the republican party from walking out of the powersharing executive in return the dup has secured reforms to the way loyalist marches are handled in northern ireland including the abolition of the parades commission body most unionists regard as biased in favour of nationalists crosscommunity vote will now be held in the stormont assembly on 9 march before the policing and justice powers are devolved from london on 12 april brown told reporters the achievements have been as great as they are inspirational this moment and this agreement belongs to the people of northern ireland all of the people and now more than ever before so does their future this is the last chapter of long and troubled story and the beginning of new chapter after decades of violence years of talks weeks of stalemate cowen praised both unionists and nationalists for making fair and balanced compromises to bridge the divisions and said the quality of the negotiations meant that the devolved institutions can and will work the northern ireland secretary shaun woodward said the deal would further isolate republican dissidents who have launched three separate gun and bomb attacks against police stations in the province over the last 10 days the deal would absolutely make northern ireland safer place he said the dup leader peter robinson said the agreement will be more enduring because of the time spent in forming it referring back to the belfast agreement of 1998 when negotiations bore fruit at the 11th hour the sinn fein president gerry adams described the current deal and the rescue of powersharing as yet another very good friday jeffrey donaldson told the guardian the dups 36strong assembly team was now unanimously in favour,0.987098753452301

5356,see hus analysis of where we are on eas but also on the us japan and chinese urbanization and trade patterns nothing that new but valuable coming from him the australian 19 jun 10 embracing everyone from the us to india greg sheridan foreign editor george yeo singapores foreign minister is one of the most dazzlingly clever people you could meet in southeast asia singapore is society that notoriously produces hardheads in its strategic outlook but yeo combines singapores characteristic hardheadedness with depth of historical understanding and context as well as lively human sympathy for the diversity of the region that surrounds him which at any event find almost unique remember interviewing him at the height of the east asian economic crisis in 1997 and asking whether this crisis shattered the idea of asia as the growing centre of the global economy as numerous foolishly triumphalist western commentators were then suggesting no it doesnt yeo told me at the most it might put back the forecasts by five or 10 years it moved the graph little to the right it didnt change the trends on that yeo was absolutely right but it is also yeos ability to apply the insights of history to the real problems of asia today which make him formidable this week yeo spent few days in australia and caught up with him for one of those slightly mesmerising historical tour de force conversations in which he specialises it is no secret singapore had the most serious reservations about kevin rudds proposal to establish an asiapacific community the prime minister wanted the us india and russia included in regional body which could deal with strategic issues as well as trade and economics singapores hesitation over the rudd proposal came because it thought that the association of southeast asian nations of which it is key member could be sidelined asked yeo whether the region was now clear on what it wanted its organisations to accomplish we still need lot more discussion he said the vision is going to change dramatically with the emergence of china and india on the global stage the configuration is evolving much faster than most of us would have preferred but thats the reality weve got to work with we need regional architecture which is able to accommodate the stresses the single most important relationship is between the us and china increasingly the relationship between india and china is becoming more important think eventually triangular relationship will decide the big issues of war and peace in asia this century the triangle consisting of the us china and india yeo saw rudd and foreign minister stephen smith in canberra and now describes canberra and singapore as being in harmony on the evolution of regional organisations this is how he saw it having played out when prime minister rudd proposed the apc dick woolcott rudds envoy went round the region he did not visit all countries he made it quite plain to some that only the big countries of asean need to be involved we talked among ourselves,0.9950268864631653
5356,and quite soon the conclusion was reached that asean was going to be sidelined so there was an immediate blowback from the region to pm rudds credit he quickly clarified this that asean is central to his conception of the apc and that that was his vision from the very beginning said all of us in the region are very relieved to hear that separately we had former japanese prime minister yukio hatoyama articulating his view of an east asian region apparently centred on china japan and korea it created as you would expect natural reaction in southeast asia that got us all thinking in the region how to keep russia and the us in the region in way thats comfortable for long time weve been thinking about china more recently about india yeo pointed out that earlier regional organisations also evolved slowly in particular the east asia summit which includes australia and new zealand as well as asean china japan south korea and india he said it took us long time to create the eas structure some preferred it to be based on the asean plus three china japan korea harking back to former malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamads east asian caucus others felt thats too limiting if its just asean plus three that may be little lopsided because of the economic weight of the plus three so we thought if we have india on one side and australia and new zealand to the south theres certain natural equipoise then it took many discussions the russians wanted to join the eas but we felt this should not be rushed russia is too important country there was some unhappiness from the russians that we did not accommodate them in the eas at that time former us president george bush did not want to join the eas but he worried that the eas might exclude the us from the region we told our american friends that it could not be purely an asian thing because australia and new zealand were in it in any case countries like singapore would never want an eas to be exclusive what would threaten us most is if the world developed into blocs so where do we end up today when met pm rudd thanked him for helping to catalyse the thinking of asean so now there are two possibilities either an eas expanded for russia and the us or separate asean plus eight including the us and russia configuration in fact had very interesting discussion with prime minister rudd think in the end hes happy to let asean members decide and he doesnt want to interfere in our regional discussion so you can describe what yeo outlines as either win or loss for rudd whatever evolves nobody is going to call it the asiapacific community and no one is going to imagine that rudd was its founder as everyone accepts that bob hawke founded apec in 1989 on the other hand it does seem as though its very much more than likely that there will finally be,0.8584623336791992
5356,regional organisation embracing everyone from the us to india which is able to discuss security that is pretty much rudds policy aim and as yeo constructively puts it rudd has influenced asean thinking friends of rudd can describe it as the embodiment of his vision and fulfilment of his initiative his enemies can say the apc came to nothing and was failure in australian diplomacy certainly yeo casts it in constructive light there is only space to give the smallest sampling of yeos prodigiously rich insights on other issues on the us he said both australia and singapore feel it in our bones that the us will remain great power for many decades it is vast country always throwing up new ideas always on the boil it has sunny disposition we in singapore and australia feel it in our bones that one way or another they will get out of their current difficulties on china asked whether its political development was keeping pace with its growth in power financial and military so it could manage that new power in way that was beneficial to everybody yeo stressed that he was sure beijings preoccupations were internal and said china is the no 1 trading partner for japan korea taiwan hong kong india and already no 2 for new zealand and for all the countries in asia the graph points in the same direction the historical process is high drama in china it was historically because of the large rural peasantry that maoism developed as different ideology from bolshevism china was 20 per cent urban its now 40 per cent urban and will go to 80 per cent or 90 per cent the urbanisation of europe was languid by comparison but look at dickens or victor hugo look at the huge reaction in europe to urbanisation and industrialisation in china its all compressed if they succeed they will be the greatest nation on earth the chinese know they have to learn new tricks the skills which brought them to power wont keep them in power he recalled that early in chinas economic modernisation program it was fascinated by how singapore as mostly chinese nation ran its society in such an orderly and effective manner combining rapid economic growth with social order and respect for tradition then that interest seemed to wane but now chinese delegations are back again in large numbers fascinated particularly with how singapore manages the politics of being big and booming city mainland chinese are even sitting in on politicians electoral clinics in singapore observing how real problems are recognised integrated into the system and dealt with asked yeo too whether he thought japan could sustain the stabilising role it has played in asia these past 60 years he replied their politics now are mess partly because they fit the pieces together so closely reconfiguring the pieces is difficult lot of japanese politics now is not about fitting the pieces together but pulling them apart the dp1 came to power determined to pull the pieces apart the liberal democratic party from,0.9967578053474426

5596,encouraging alternatives to opium production holbrooke secondly rule of law we are spending we are spending the money you have authorized for us to create justice system which can cut into the talibans propaganda about corruption and lack of justice system third counternarcotics we have ended poppy eradication radical change because all we were doing by eradicating poppy seeds poppy crops was driving farmers poor farmers into the hands of the taliban fourth major program of subnational governance where we are putting aid directly to the district level fifth major effort in specific areas some of which were alluded to earlier such as electricity for kandahar senator kerry asked earlier about kandahar one of the major issues here is to bring electricity to the people as benefit of the international presence the whole range of activities we have is designed to support the country and to support general petraeus counter insurgency effort he and was his counterpart until two weeks ago when he moved to kabul we have worked intimately in an effort to create joint civilianmilitary effort and am happy to provide you with every detail you wish in private briefings on behalf of me and my team point number two in regard to the end state issue you raised want to be clear on the difference between end state and exit strategy if we this is my personal view senator but if we walk away from afghanistan again as we did 21 years ago the consequences will be similarly catastrophic because of the unique strategic position of afghanistan and the reaction that would have in pakistan china india and the country to afghanistans west iran as well as the larger region that includes russia saudi arabia india and even extending to western europe which is concerned about terrorism from that region just as much as we are so hope that when we talk about end state we talk about sustainable end state which involves continued american economic and development assistance and we continue to fulfill our obligations to train the police and the military this will not be cheap but it will be fraction of the money that is now being authorized and appropriated for the military campaign when we will be able to transition to that is impossible for me or anyone to say but it wont be on single day it will be gradual process and that is what the review in december and the presidents decisionmaking will focus on corker in our foreign policy generally speaking know weve had some rough times over the last several years its been something that weve been able to address in bipartisan way and think that the issues that youre dealing with that were dealing with in afghanistan are incredibly tough still dont havent understood what the administration was saying in the beginning thats not to be critical of them just dont understand still dont understand ive met with you and your staff over at the state department its just incredibly vague to me and think what we are doing we,0.8462051153182983
5596,that its threat to the homeland then we have an honest difference of opinion but think the times square bombing incident shows clearly how dangerous that situation is secondly on the civilian mission again its in support of single civilianmilitary counterinsurgency mission and we have benchmarks requested and required by the congress and submitted to you and our overarching goal here is always the same to disrupt dismantle and defeat al qaida and prevent its ability to threaten the united states and we believe all of us and there is no division on this in the executive branch that the situation we face out there is direct threat we believe that before the times square situation occurred and dont think anything could have proved it more vividly and to achieve this we have to degrade the taliban as well because they are part of the enemys structure different part but an integral part that we face now the afghan government doesnt yet have the capacity to deal with this on its own how could they after 30 years of war and so the civilian part of it the things ive just mentioned to you police government capacity rule of law subnational government training provincial officials womens empowerment and whole series of other major issues are part of our civilian programs and were happy to come back up to your office we appreciated your visit to us and continue this dialogue our civilian strategy is designed from keeping al qaida at bay and its designed to help afghan institutions establish conditions for stable governance our plan has these benchmarks which have been briefed to you and your colleagues and were happy to discuss them in detail at any time,0.9583221673965454

5749,hrc below is an oped on the national security strategy wrote for tomorrows outlook unfortunately they give it horrible title but think the piece turned out alright best sandy by samuel berger samuel berger chair of the global strategy firm albright stonebridge group served as national security advisor to president clinton from 1997 to 2001 president obamas national security strategy released by the white house on thursday tackles delicate but unavoidable question how do we respond to new and old security challenges in an era of financial distress at home and reordering of political power abroad for some time now it has been clear that the definition of us national security strategy needs rethinking the september 11 attacks global economic crisis cyberterror threats and even the environmental catastrophe in the gulf underscore that the challenges america faces in 2010 have changed even from just decade ago and while americas military supremacy is certainly not at risk new international arrangements such as the shift from the g7 club of powerful nations to the g20 which incorporates emerging nations from china to brazil are needed so that the costs and benefits of stable international order are shared the united states cannot solve most global threats without others nor should we bear the burden alone enter the national security strategy in my experience these congressionally mandated documents can easily become laborious and impenetrable or mere compendiums of bureaucratic pleading from various parts of the government make sure you do right by japan dont step on the pentagon the challenge which president clinton insisted upon to me and his other advisers is to provide strategic framework that is clarifying to the rest of the world and informs administration decision makers up and down the line its not blueprint for action but means to convey the presidents principles and priorities in obamas case the new sober and comprehensive 52page strategy incorporates the new realities and breaks with past strategies in several key respects but it also reflects an understanding that we face enduring challenges nuclear proliferation terrorism and regional conflicts for which the best response is return to fundamentals one such fundamental is the strength of our economy at time when the aftereffects of financial crisis and the fiscal burden of two long wars have raised fears of an overextended america the administration makes case for economic and technological renewal as crucial underpinning of us security the president made this case in his west point speech last weekend at no time in human history he said has nation of diminished economic vitality maintained its military and political primacy another fundamental challenge is arms control and nuclear proliferation by seeking strategic arms cuts with russia the president has returned to long bipartisan tradition that languished during the prior administration and by convening global summit on securing nuclear material this spring obama has given new urgency and global purchase to the effort started in 1991 when sens sam nunn and richard lugar first initiated program to lock down nuclear materials on terrorism the strategy builds on the past but,0.9814877510070801
5749,breaks with it as well presidents clinton bush and obama each have deployed all of americas tools military power homeland defense law enforcement sanctions intelligence and vigorous efforts to cut off terrorist financing but the critical difference in the obama strategy is that it rejects the global war on terror lens through which the prior administration viewed the challenge this is not global war against tactic terrorism or religion islam the new strategy says we are at war with specific network alqaeda and its terrorist affiliates this sharper focus avoids alienating many in the muslim world ensures the support of key allies who never accepted the broader construct and avoids the overreactions that led us to forsake the fight against alqaeda fight in afghanistan and turn our efforts to the unrelated threat from saddam husseins iraq in perhaps the most dramatic departure from the strategy of its predecessor the obama administration has restored less provocative policy on the use of military force in the 2002 national security strategy president bush articulated the rationale for preemptive war just weeks before seeking un resolution to invade iraq the new strategy restores the principles that have guided administrations for decades the use of force should be last resort should weigh all the costs and benefits and should have as much international support as possible the administration reserves the right to act unilaterally for example against alqaeda and its allies but resurrects the principle president clinton often described as together where possible alone where necessary president obamas critics have focused on his diplomatic engagement with hostile states like iran and north korea the president sets forth his rationale to create opportunities to resolve differences strengthen the international communitys support for our actions learn about the intentions and nature of closed regimes and plainly demonstrate to the public within those nations that their governments are to blame for their isolation in the case of iran washingtons outstretched hand has not resulted in irans compliance but attempts to engage have helped ensure that the worlds attention is focused on irans intransigence rather than washingtons refusal to negotiate without doubt there are gaps between principle and practice despite the obama administrations stated goal of doubling exports in the next five years it has not put its muscle behind trade agreements with south korea panama and colombia and the clarity of its call to respect human rights has at times been muted in the face of tough realities sixteen months into this administration there has been much progress but many of the true tests of this strategy lie ahead in the strategys conclusions the obama administration evokes an even earlier era calling for both political parties to restore the cooperation and common purpose so crucial to our success during the dark days of the cold war despite the intense debates at the time over nuclear arms control central america and détente nearly all american supported the containment of communism in that same spirit the administrations framework deserves broad bipartisan support we can and should argue out our differences over detention,0.9496712684631348

6514,you asked about this it was walter isaacson new bbg chief wants more money to combat enemies such as china and russia posted by josh rogin tuesday october 5 2010 the broadcasting board of governors bbg has new chairman in walter isaacson and the former cnn and time magazine chief is calling for even more money for the bbg to combat the public diplomacy efforts of americas enemies which he identifies as iran venezuela russia and china the bbg which oversees 700 million annual budget to run such organizations as the voice of america radio free europe and radio free asia funds breakthrough reporting in some of the most dangerous parts of the world but at the same time is facing increased competition from other governments forays into international broadcasting isaacson said that other countries are stepping up their international broadcasting efforts and that the congress must allow the us government to do the same we cant allow ourselves to be outcommunicated by our enemies he said youve got russia today irans press tv venezuelas telesur and of course china is launching an international broadcasting 24hour news channel with correspondents around the world and has reportedly set aside six to ten billion dollars weve to go to capitol hill with that number to expand their overseas media operations isaacson said that combating internet censorship would be major focus of the bbg under his leadership and that china and iran were the prime targets china iran and other countries block democratic impulses using their later technologies and beijing has deployed armies of cyber militias to go after their countrys cyber dissidents he said the bbg is at the forefront of combating this through constant innovation and technical evolution our engineers are opening up the internet gateway for audiences in china and iran we know where we stand in the fight for internet freedom isaacson said wherever there is firewall its our duty to storm it to denounce it and to circumvent it isaacson was speaking at last weeks 60th anniversary celebration for radio free europe which he credited as contributing to the end of the cold war he made it clear the bbgs outlets will stick to reporting the news objectively even if that conflicts with the foreign policy of the obama administration its sometimes said that our international broadcasting is in difficult position because by law and by tradition its tasked with two separate missions that might conflict first of all covering the news with the highest journalistic standards and secondly being part of americas public diplomacy by accurately conveying its policies and values to the world isaacson said let me say to you my fellow journalists that will stress and we will stress the primacy of the first of these missions our mission of being credible journalists because in fact its the only way to carry out the second mission you cant do it unless youre credible and telling the truth and in the end the truth is on our side pressed by the cable to explain exactly what that means,0.9779972434043884
6514,especially in light of reports that the obama administration sought to influence bbg reporting after the disputed iranian presidential elections isaacson promised he wouldnt hesitate to air views that contradict american foreign policy on bbg stations he said that the goals of american foreign policy and the objectives of credible journalism overlap about 90 percent of the time as for the other 10 percent choice must be made feel its the role of the bbg to always make the choice on the side of credible journalism just as you would in the private sector isaacson said we can never compromise our credibility and in doing so that will probably help further the foreign policy interests of the united states but if its ever real conflict our goal one is to protect our credibility,0.9205819368362427

6568,less controversial for his support of the invasion of iraq which he saw as necessary to ending what he called the monstrous dictatorship of saddam hussein mr vargas llosa has now left politics and he believes that he can better shape the world with his pen or as he told me in lima through writing one can change history not all of his work is dark aunt julia and the scriptwriter is punctuated with humor and the bad girl about one mans worldwide pursuit of an elusive lover is thoroughly entertaining read the one constant is perceptive and empathetic glimpse into wide range of human experience as mr vargas llosa wrote in his 2001 essay about literature nothing better protects human being against the stupidity of prejudice racism religious or political sectarianism and exclusivist nationalism than this truth that invariably appears in great literature that men and women of all nations and places are essentially equal ms parker is an international affairs fellow at the council on foreign relations,0.9955551028251648

6570,memo published in politico what we found was clear boehner is target well worth defining who readily stands for precisely what americans perceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for congressional republicans perhaps the only group left who poll worse than congressional democrats with swing voters we tested both paragraphlength narratives and singlesentence language designed to capture the essence of those narratives and in each case we tested them against the toughest opposition language we could test them against the words of boehner cantor limbaugh and others combined in defining the obamapelosireid agenda what we found in brief is that we could beat tough gop narrative about the jobkilling socialists in the white house and congress by 15 to 20 points with two narratives starring boehner in the leading role with best supporting bad actor going in one of the narratives to karl rove and his corporate allies and we could win with over 15 different sentencelong descriptions of whats the matter with boehner with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against tough conservative attack on the obamapelosireid axis of conservative evil the narratives that most moved likely voters including swing voters who preferred them by doubledigits over tough republican rhetoric made clear whose voices boehner would be speaking for as speaker eg the wall street executives he convened to try to block wall street reform they harnessed the same populist anger at the hijacking of washington by corporate special interests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the political spectrum and they focused on the extremism of the party boehner would speak for narrative that brought karl rove into the picture was slightly more polarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely democratic voters in some ways what was most surprising was the success of the singleline statements of what we need in speaker and who john boehner really speaks for although these singleline statements came after the narratives and likely reflect the power of branding even over the course of brief online encounter with voters they ranged from relatively lofty and aspirational eg we need speaker who is also listener who can hear the voices of ordinary americans theme colleagues and found highly resonant across the political spectrum in message testing on the role of money in politics to the harderedged eg the speaker of the house is heartbeat away from the presidency unfortunately we know where john boehners heart is and it isnt with the middle class or john boehner understands deficits hes spent nearly 20 years in washington creating them if theres message in this message research it is at once shortterm and longterm in the short run if democrats want to hang onto their seats in november they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle class and small business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are hijacking our democracy to use boehner as poster child for the party whose primary commitment is to the latter and whose tan,0.9889854192733765

6688,know im not supposed to lift my head from the qddr but just thought you would like to see this its for all the ideas you wanted promoted when you picked me am the crossroads nation by david brooks bill clinton used to talk about building bridge to the 21st century president obama talks about laying down new foundation but clinton was always vague about what the land on the other side of that bridge was going to look like and obama is vague about what edifice is going to go on top of that foundation they are vague because nobody is clear about what sort of country america is going to be in 2030 or 2050 nobody has quite defined americas coming economic identity in thinking about this question it probably helps to start at the beginning five hundred years ago agriculture was the major economic activity one hundred years ago it was industrial production now of course were living in an information age innovation and creativity are the engines of economic growth howard gardner of harvard once put together composite picture of the extraordinarily creative person she comes from little place somewhat removed from the center of power and influence as an adolescent she feels herself outgrowing her own small circle she moves to metropolis and finds group of people who share her passions and interests she gets involved with team to create something amazing then at some point she finds her own problem which is related to and yet different from the problems that concern others in her group she breaks off and struggles and finally emerges with some new thing she brings it back to her circle it is tested refined and improved the main point in this composite story is that creativity is not solitary process it happens within networks it happens when talented people get together when idea systems and mentalities merge now imagine you are this creative person in the year 2010 2025 or 2050 you are living in some small town in ukraine or kenya or some other place foreign or domestic you long to break out and go to place where people are gathering to think about the things you are thinking about creating the things you want to create if you are passionate about fashion maybe you will go to paris if its engineering maybe itll be germany but if you are passionate about many other spheres suspect youll want to be in america youll want to be in the us because english has become the global language youll want to come because american universities lead the world in research and draw many of the best minds from all corners of the earth youll want to be there because american institutions are relatively free from corruption intellectual property is protected huge venture capital funds already exist moreover the united states is universal nation there are already people there with connections all over the world nation of immigrants is more permeable than say chinese society you also observe that america hosts the right,0.9982370138168335

6888,dropped by 11 points since 2005 erupting so many years after the september 11th trauma this spasm of antimuslim bigotry might seem oddly timed and unexpectedly spontaneous but think again its the fruit of an organized longterm campaign by tight confederation of rightwing activists and operatives who first focused on isiamophobia soon after the september 11th attacks but only attained critical mass during the obama era it was then that embittered conservative forces voted out of power in 2008 sought with remarkable success to leverage cultural resentment into political and partisan gain this network is obsessively fixated on the supposed spread of muslim influence in america its apparatus spans continents extending from tea party activists here to the european far right it brings together in common cause rightwing ultra zionists christian evangelicals and racist british soccer hooligans it reflects an aggressively pro israel sensibility with its key figures venerating the jewish state as middle eastern fort apache on the front lines of the global war on terror and urging the us and various european powers to emulate its heavyhanded methods little of recent american jslamophobia with astrong emphasis on the phobia is sheer happenstance years before tea party shock troops massed for angry protests outside the proposed site of an islamic community center in lower manhattan representatives of the israel lobby and the jewishamerican establishment launched campaign against pro palestinian campus activism that would prove seedbed for everything to come that campaign quickly and perhaps predictably morphed into series of crusades against mosques and islarilic schools which in turn attracted an assortment of shady but exceptionally energetic militants into the networks ranks besides providing the initial energy for the islamophobic crusade conservative elements from within the proisrael lobby bankrolled the networks apparatus enabling it to influence the national debate one philanthropist in particular has provided the beneficence to propel the campaign ahead he is littleknown los angeles area software security entrepreneur named aubrey chernick who operates out of security consulting firm blandly named the national center for crisis and continuity coordination former trustee of the washington institute for near east policy which has served as think tank for the american israeli public affairs committee aipac frontline lobbying group for israel chernick is said to be worth 750 million chemicks fortune is puny compared to that of the billionaire koch brothers extraction industry titans who fund tea partyrelated groups like americans for prosperity and it is dwarfed by the financial empire of haim saban the israeli american media baron who is one of the largestorivate donors to the democratic party and recently matched 9 million raised for the friends of the israeli defense forces in single night however by injecting his money into small but influential constellation of groups and individuals with narrow agenda chernick has had considerable impact through the fairtmook foundation private entity he and his wife joyce control chernick has provided funding to groups ranging from the anti defamation league adl and camera right wing proisrael media watchdog outfit to violent israeli settlers living on palestinian lands and figures like,0.8310258984565735

7084,keith richards has memories to burn by janet maslin it is 3 pm eastern daylight time in the new york office of keith richardss manager place that might look ordinary if every wall and shelf were not crammed with some of the worlds most glorious rock roll memorabilia mr richards has 3 oclock appointment come on in hell be here in minute an assistant says and here he comes in minute at this from man who once prided himself for operating on keith time as in the security staff ate the shepherds pie that keith wanted in his dressing room then everyone in this packed stadium can bloody well wait the rolling stones dont play until another shepherds pie shows up chalk up the promptness to the mans new incarnation he is now keith richards distinguished author true he is far from the only rock star to turn memoirist and far from the only rolling stone to write book about himself very much about himself the ravenhaired ron wood wrote ronnie in which he described brian jones as me in blond wig bill wyman the bands retired bass player and bean counter wrote stone alone in which not 15shilling demo disc went unmentioned now mr richards has written the keeper life big fierce gamechanging account of the stones nearly halfcenturylong adventure its the most difficult thing ive ever done he says about the book id rather make ro records but he sounds anything but weary and he seems refreshed bearing surprisingly little resemblance to the battered kohl eyed pirate keith richards who looks like 50 miles of bad road today in neutral street clothes and hotgreen shoes he is positively debonair on his hands the ubiquitous silver skull ring swollen knuckles the thin white scar from hunk of steaming phosphorus that burned his finger to the bone while he played through concert without stopping on his head both headband and raffish strawcolored hat gray tufts poking out in all directions not single gewgaw hangs off it ive been through that phase he says dont know that the hair will take the pressure anymore hes been through quite lot of phases and theyre all on the page in life the boy scout really the tyro rocker the lovestruck kid mad for ronnie spector unbeknownst to phil spector the astonished new star the heroinaddicted older one the jaded veteran of countless world tours and the longtime sparring partner of mick jagger despite tabloid shock over the bickering in the book these two have seriously been calling each other names at least since the early 198os all of this is recounted with straightup candor and some of it is easily sensationalized but the books single biggest stunner is handwritten note on its jacket flap believe it or not havent forgotten any of it how he is asked is this humanly possible from man as well known for stupefaction as satisfaction think my main concern at the beginning was whether my memory was really reliable he says fox had to do little sleuthing fox is james,0.7595698237419128
7084,fox the journalist and author of white mischief who has been mr richardss friend over many years and was his collaborator in putting life together it was sold to little brown company for reported advance of more than 7 million mr fox wound up researching mr richardss past conducting interviews with those who knew him long ago and drawing upon wonderfully candid old letters and journal entries spent day practising the 19yearold mr richards wrote in january 1963 when the stones were just beginning to play in public worthwhile hope also exhumed 1962 letter from mr richards to his aunt patty describing boy he had known in primary school mick jagger he signs off luffkeith xxxxx these artifacts turned out to be the richards equivalent of prousts madeleines though mr richards whose reading taste runs to naval history and the novels of patrick obrian and george macdonald fraser would hardly put it that way in any case they prompted recollections that he never expected to rediscover and life began to click once his stories were told and draft was written he and mr fox wound up sitting together with separate copies of the manuscript as mr fox read b6 the whole book aloud what couldnt guess was that hed be such very good natural editor mr fox reached by mail says of mr richards he cut accordingly for pace and rhythm real musical cut as for calling the book life mr richards did some editing there too my life was what the book was to be called said tell you what just cut off the my and youve got title he says he might just as appropriately have used another title he likes keep it dark but he says im saving it for song the contents of life are dark enough already the book begins with 1975 drug bust in arkansas and judge who was persuaded to free mr richards after confiscating his hunting knife which still hangs in the courtroom and having picture taken with him how did mr richards get so lucky really cant explain it he says deadpan about that now maybe ive got an honest face it covers many other arrests too as well as mr richardss grueling efforts to kick his heroin addiction which he claims to have done successfully 30 years ago stories like this arent told very much he insists there arent many people willing to tell them then there are the other health hazards that the book describes like electrocution my most spectacular one was in sacramento he now says with smile drifting off into fondsounding reverie that involves guitar string touching an ungrounded microphone and clouds of smoke billowing out of his mouth he has good laugh at the memory of finding himself in hospital and hearing doctor say well they either wake up or they dont life has already attracted undue attention for schoolyardsounding anatomical swipe at mr jagger but this is book that pulls no punches and most of its disses are more serious than that coldblooded and vicious are only,0.6110655069351196

7503,diplomacy before and after conflict by marc grossman conflict is universal condition older than diplomacy while conflict is constant in human history the nature of armed conflict and especially the nature of 21stcentury warfare has been transformed general rupert smith identified these changes in his book the utility of force the ends for which we fight are changing we fight amongst the people our conflicts tend to be timeless we fight so as not to lose the force on each occasion new uses are found for old weapons the sides are mostly nonstate2 the nature of 21stcentury diplomacy is also changing to be successful diplomats must simultaneously shape act upon and react to global challenges as hans binnendijk and richard kugler of the national defense university argue no single problem danger or threat holds the key to the worlds future what matters is their interaction and the simultaneity of our responses3 the definition of victory too is different today twentyfirstcentury national security success will encompass comprehensive definition of security and will be achieved by the broadest simultaneous application of all elements of national power this is the key to understanding philip bobbitts concept of preclusive victory which he describes as anticipatory precautionary attention to possible futures requiring an expansive and integrated approach to modern diplomacy defense and development diplomatic strategy designed to produce preclusive victory will include conflict prevention successful negotiation deterrence the preparation for conflict should all else fail and efforts to establish order ensure stability and promote political and economic pluralism after conflict diplomats have always been participants in both the prevention and management of conflict and its aftermath the conflict prevention side of diplomacy occupied much of my time at the state department from 1993 to 1997 as the departments executive secretary and us ambassador to turkey postconflict diplomacy was defining issue of the last third of my career at state as assistant secretary of state for european affairs and as under secretary of state for political affairs from 2001 to 2005 have tried to draw upon my experiences and observations to discuss here the scope and complexity of modern diplomacy the methods and goals needed to prevent conflict diplomacys role when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable and the contribution diplomacy can make to restoring stability following conflict diplomacy and conflict prevention thanks to the efforts of scholars and practitioners we can now make better use of the methods and theory of conflict prevention the united states institute of peace and the woodrow wilson international center for scholars are two among many institutions that have taken leadership role in these efforts michael lund practitionerscholar notes that the present uncoordinated and patchy nature of preventive diplomacy reflects the absence of any accepted international conflict prevention regime or system of governancethat is of agreed upon arrangements through which geographic jurisdictions are allocated functional responsibilities are assigned norms and procedures are formulated and actors are held accountable for their responsibilities he asks the crucial question to all those who seek to coordinate and rationalize system of preventive diplomacy where should,0.9960415363311768
7503,responsibility for the tasks of preventive action be locatedearly warning the decision to act the formulation of response or the provision of bureaucratic and political support should it be horizontal across different organizations or actors or should it be vertical up or down their chains of command6 an example of conflict prevention that meets lunds tests was the effort undertaken by the north atlantic treaty organization nato in close collaboration with the european union eu and the organisation for security and cooperation in europe and supported by the united states to avoid civil war in macedonia in 2001 it is difficult now to recall that until september 11 2001 the possibility of civil war in macedonia was leading international headline this successful campaign of conflict prevention was defined by the remarkable personal and institutional cooperation between the nato secretary general lord robertson and the eu high representative for the common foreign and security policy and former nato secretary general javier solana spoke often during this period to lord robertson solana and ambassador james pardew whom president george bush and secretary colin powell appointed as the us representative to the effort and who along with francois leotard the eu special envoy played crucial role in negotiating and implementing the ohrid framework agreement as direct participant senior nato official mark laity stated that there are insights about modern diplomacy and conflict prevention to be drawn from this effort including the need for personal and institutional teamwork the importance of early engagement in trying to head off violence the need to choose the right people for tasks of this kind including 21stcentury diplomats who can act unconventionally and the necessity of being able to apply appropriate force quickly diplomacy when conflict is or seems to be unavoidable when diplomacy fails to prevent conflict the role of the diplomat changes the new requirement may be to justify the use of force when all efforts to avoid conflict fail or to seek to address the underlying source of conflict when force is or seems to be inevitable and imperative the february 1999 diplomatic negotiations in rambouillet france were designed to show the world that nato and the contact group were willing to make one last effort to avoid using military force to stop slobodan milosevics attacks in kosovo was in rambouillet as assistant secretary of state for european affairs to support secretary madeleine albright after the first day or so of the meeting there was so much chaos that urged secretary albright to depart rambouillet and leave the negotiating to those of us more junior my strategy was that by not being present the secretary of state and the administrationcould keep distance from an outcome that might be unacceptable to the united states the secretary had different vision albright hoped rambouillet would end the brutality against the kosovars but she was also prepared for the meeting to fail and thereby all options for avoiding military conflict would be exhausted her idea was that we had to be seen to be doing everything we could diplomatically including her,0.9883171916007996
7503,home they needed to be protected and for 11 years the united sates and some of its allies including turkey worked on the ground there to recreate functioning society and then protected this area from saddam by enforcing nofly zone these years were also punctuated by activity in the balkans as richard holbrooke recounts some of the predayton negotiations with bosnian leader alija izetbegovi took place in my residence while was ambassador to turkey7 as one of holbrookes successors as assistant secretary for european affairs watched the effort made by ambassadors robert gelbard and james dobbins to implement the dayton accords by applying wholeofgovernment efforts in postconflict post yugoslavia picked up the diplomatic thread again as under secretary of state for political affairs promoting reconciliation development political progress and nationbuilding in kosovo other postconflict diplomacy efforts in haiti east timor and liberia called upon the resources of the united states and other governments to try to create the conceptual space for development and sustained peace the us effort in colombia too highlighted the need to focus on an integrated and crosssectoral approach which included disarmament demobilization and reintegration of former combatants and promoted justice in postconflict society but the main events in modern diplomacys postconflict paradigm are afghanistan and iraq the key to understanding us diplomacy in postconflict afghanistan and iraq is to recall the profound disagreement inside the us government especially between dod and state about whether the united states should engage in nationbuilding policy president bush had campaigned against in 2000 state department professionals were generally proud of the effort the united states had made in nationbuilding and in peacekeeping supporting the deployment of us military forces to participate for example in the multinational force and observers in the sinai and in peacekeeping and nationbuilding activities in east timor haiti and the balkans most believed that nationbuilding properly funded and executed was an effective longterm tool of integrated modern diplomacy for the united states the effort to create new afghan government after the overthrow of the taliban was piece of classical diplomacy carried out in the 21stcentury context8 secretary powell directed ambassador dobbins to support the regional negotiation hosted by the germans in bonn in 2001 to create new afghan government to succeed dobbins worked with all the key players including representatives from iran to support major role for the united nations and put hamid karzai in position to lead new afghanistan but as dobbins has written the bush administration having overthrown the taliban and installed new government in kabul determined that american troops would do no peacekeeping and that peacekeepers from other countries would not be allowed to venture beyond the kabul city limits public security throughout the rest of the country would be left entirely to afghans despite the fact that afghanistan had no army and no police force2 the struggle over nationbuilding also hampered american attempts to get sufficient amounts of us or international assistance to afghanistan washington accepted the diffusion of responsibility there with the british taking charge of counternarcotics the italians reforming the justice sector,0.9945489764213562
7503,and the germans training police this satisfied the need for burdensharing but did not lead to success in addition postconflict resources focused by the united states on afghanistan were small compared to other recent postconflict situations even including kosovo american diplomats who followed dobbins to the embassy in kabul over the years faced the legacy of this lack of attention and underinvestment22 the state department participated at many levels in the national security councilled planning for postconflict iraq much of the planning was detailed but focused on lessons learned from the first gulf war the departments future of iraq project while important would not have solved iraqs postwar problems state did not have the capacity to take responsibility for the immediate postconflict administration of iraq and its leadership agreed to the executive order creating postconflict iraq structure that reported to the secretary of defense there is no need here to recount the lost lives and lost opportunities so well chronicled by others in the immediate postconflict period in iraq although dobbinss argument that looking back the coalition provisional authority accomplished great deal under trying circumstances is worth noting23 on july 1 2004 the state department did officially open on time and on budget an embassy in baghdad which allowed an expansion of diplomacy and led to more comprehensive senior civilianmilitary cooperation there is another important lesson to draw from recent postconflict efforts the need to have adequate civilian capacity to respond including role for revitalized us agency for international development usaid as this journal chronicled in an article by ambassador john herbst the secretary of states coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization scrs his office was mandated to develop wholeofgovernment civilian response to stability operations and to ensure civilianmilitary coordination the civilian response corps crc is in an early stage and ultimately will be made up of reserve component in addition to the existing active and standby components the personnel are anticipated to represent the full range of sector experts engineers lawyers judges corrections officials diplomats development experts public administrators public health officials city planners border control officials economists and others currently the active and standby components that are being stepped up are drawn from state usaid and core group of domestic us agencies once congressionally funded the reserves would be drawn from state and local governments and the private sector between january 2008 and may 2009 56 crc members deployed to 11 countries including afghanistan for planning purposes and there are realistic plans to have 250 active members and 1000 standby members ready to deploy by the end of 2010 there are now at least 14 other countries with whom the united states allies that have civilian peacebuilding capacitysome including stability or civilian police and employing wholeof government or comprehensive approaches similar to that created by washington several in fact have higher budgets proportionate to their gross national products than americas25 one way for state to further support the scrs effort would be to consider creating new personnel specialty the expeditionary diplomat washingtons diplomatic personnel have of course always been in one,0.54737389087677
7503,sense expeditionary the majority of the foreign service is deployed abroad the majority of the time but the post911 diplomatic experience and especially the effort in iraq and afghanistan means that state needs to be more explicit about the expeditionary nature of some of its future diplomatic work and should prepare small but significant number of people to serve successfully in the hardest places at moments notice experience with the provincial reconstruction teams in iraq and afghanistan the lessons learned with scrs and the example of diplomats who have pursued careers in the toughest posts should lead state leadership to conclude that this is step worth taking the first requirement would be advanced training some of it provided by dod and some by the central intelligence agency for those entering diplomats who believe they want to pursue this special career path these entering officers would make an explicit choice and understand that an investment in their extra training would require their service in hard places just as we now ask diplomats who take the hardest languages chinese or arabic for exampleto serve more than one tour using their skills since these expeditionary diplomats will not need to meet the same age and physical requirements as special operations in the military the state department could allow people to opt in and out of this special force during their careers as long as they have the proper training this would allow flexibility across the institution and encourage those who desire or whose family circumstances might change over time to participate as well the department would also need to make sure those taking this career path are recognized for career beyond the norm for foreign service and are promoted and rewarded the creation of scrs is symbol of the comprehensive simultaneous diplomacy needed for the future and this expeditionary diplomat could form the backbone of the state and usaid commitment to the civilian response capacity there are still key questions to be answered about civilian capacity in the face of real world situation will dod really support state departmentled operation will congress adequately fund scrs including reasonable contingency fund how will scrs and resurgent usaid work together where will the lines be drawn between immediate postconflict needs and nationbuilding there seems to be no question that the path is the right one consistent with the administrations focus on diplomacy development and defense success will come with clear direction and active implementation if we combine the observations made by several authors we arrive at this question what national policies supported by adequate human and financial resources will create the conditions during and after war to bring about preclusive victory nation building post conflict reconstruction and stability operations and counterinsurgency strategy call it what we will will be part of modern diplomacy for years to come accomplishing this task does not have to be an exclusively american responsibility and indeed one of the goals of modern american diplomats will be to make these efforts more international but for the foreseeable future the united states will need to,0.993520200252533

7616,pinstripes to cargo pants clinton tailors new vision for diplomacy by elise labatt cnn october 27 2010 pm edt story highlights it is the firstever undertaking for the state department approach will focus on american leadership through civilian power going forward diplomats likely to wear cargo pants as pinstriped suit washington cnn secretary of state hillary clinton is outlining how she plans to redefine us diplomacy and development ahead of topdown review which has taken place this year and will be released in the coming weeks in an essay in the novemberdecember issue of foreign affairs clinton previews the quadrennial diplomacy and development review commonly referred to as the qddr the review the firstever such an undertaking for the state department is meant to balance similar quadrennial review by the defense department that projects their strategy and priorities the new approach to development clinton says will focus on american leadership through civilian power both clinton and secretary of defense robert gates and have talked about demilitarizing foreign policy and clinton says the qddr will suggest how to do that with whole new set of resources for diplomacy and development much of which will be geared toward fragile states in conflict or crisis in the article clinton painted the broad strokes of the document which she called blueprint for reforms to be implemented over the next four years those reforms include modernizing and coordinating diplomacy across us government agencies creating stronger nexus between diplomacy and development and ensuring that development undertaken by the us has lasting and sustainable impact economic growth is the surest route out of poverty and expanding and strengthening middle classes around the world will be key to creating the just and sustainable international order that lies at the heart of the united states national security strategy clinton wrote in foreign affairs she said that the us ultimate goal in development was to put itself out of business by boosting up countries to assume responsibility for their own projects and future president barack obama laid out the vision and the basic pillars of the policy in september at the united nations general assembly when he released the us global development policy which changes us efforts to focus on building up countries that demonstrate good governance and economic potential but the qddr will outline how to put that policy into practice officials say the 150page document will detail everything from how the united states conducts multilateral diplomacy how the united states undertakes stabilization efforts in postconflict areas how the state department works with usaid and contractors to the types and numbers of personnel needed to implement the new approach american diplomats going forward clinton said are as likely to wear cargo pants as pinstriped suit,0.9253737926483154

7766,do that because it is more expensive and less effective than building new ones for defense purposes finally the obama administration has agreed to provide for modernization of the infrastructure essential to maintaining our nuclear arsenal funding these efforts has become part of the negotiations in the ratification process the administration has put forth 10year plan to spend 84 billion on the energy departments nuclear weapons complex much of the credit for getting the administration to add 14 billion to the originally proposed 70 billion for modernization goes to sen jon kyl the arizona republican who has been vigilant in this effort implementing this modernization program in timely fashion would be important in ensuring that our nuclear arsenal is maintained appropriately over the next decade and beyond although the united states needs strong and reliable nuclear force the chief nuclear danger today comes not from russia but from rogue states such as iran and north korea and the potential for nuclear material to fall into the hands of terrorists given those pressing dangers some question why an arms control treaty with russia matters it matters because it is in both parties interest that there be transparency and stability in their strategic nuclear relationship it also matters because russias cooperation will be needed if we are to make progress in rolling back the iranian and north korean programs russian help will be needed to continue our work to secure loose nukes in russia and elsewhere and russian assistance is needed to improve the situation in afghanistan breeding ground for international terrorism obviously the united states does not sign arms control agreements just to make friends any treaty must be considered on its merits but we have here an agreement that is clearly in our national interest and we should consider the ramifications of not ratifying it whenever new start is brought up for debate we encourage all senators to focus on national security there are plenty of opportunities to battle on domestic political issues linked to the future of the american economy with our country facing the dual threats of unemployment and growing federal debt bomb we anticipate significant conflict between democrats and republicans it is however in the national interest to ratify new start the writers were secretaries of state for the past five republican presidents unsubscribe the white house 1600 pennsylvania avenue nw washington dc 20500 2024561111,0.7510573267936707

7850,opinion december 7 2010 new start ratify with caveats the treaty helpfully reinstates onsite verification of russian nuclear forces but senators should make it clear to moscow that they dont see it as limiting us missile defenses by condoleezza rice when us president bush and russian president putin signed the moscow treaty in 2002 they addressed the nuclear threat by reducing offensive weaponsas their predecessors had but the moscow treaty was different it came in the wake of americas 2001 withdrawal from the antiballistic missile treaty of 1972 and for the first time the united states and russia reduced their offensive nuclear weapons with no agreement in place that constrained missile defenses breaking the link between offensive force reductions and limits on defense marked key moment in the establishment of new nuclear agenda no longer focused on the cold war faceoff between the warsaw pact and nato the real threat was that the worlds most dangerous weapons could end up in the hands of the worlds most dangerous regimesor of terrorists who would launch attacks more devastating than 911 and since those very rogue states also pursued ballistic missiles defenses would alongside offensive weapons be integral to the security of the united states and our allies it is in this context that we should consider the potential contribution of the new start treaty to us national security the treaty is modest reducing offensive nuclear weapons to 1550 on each sidemore than enough for deterrence while the treaty puts limits on launchers us military commanders have testified that we will be able to maintain triad of bombers submarinebased delivery vehicles and landbased delivery vehicles moreover the treaty helpfully reinstates onsite verification of russian nuclear forces which lapsed with the expiration of the original start treaty last year meaningful verification was significant achievement of presidents reagan and george hw bush and its reinstatement is crucial still there are legitimate concerns about new start that must and can be addressed in the ratification process and if the treaty is ratified in future monitoring of the obama administrations commitments first smaller forces make the modernization of our nuclear infrastructure even more urgent sen jon kyl of arizona has led valiant effort in this regard thanks to his efforts roughly 84 billion is being allocated to the department of energys nuclear weapons complex ratifying the treaty will help cement these commitments and congress should fully fund the presidents program congress should also support the defense department in modernizing our launchers as suggested in the recent defense strategy study coauthored by former secretary of defense bill perry and former national security adviser stephen hadley second the senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying this treaty the us is not reestablishing the cold war link between offensive forces and missile defenses new starts preamble is worrying in this regard as it recognizes the interrelationship of the two administration officials have testified that there is no link and that the treaty will not limit us missile defenses but congress should ensure that future defense department budgets reflect this moscow,0.9229351878166199
7850,contends that only current us missiledefense plans are acceptable under the treaty but the us must remain fully free to explore and then deploy the best defensesnot just those imagined today that includes pursuing both potential qualitative breakthroughs and quantitative increases have personally witnessed moscows tendency to interpret every utterance as binding commitment the russians need to understand that the us will use the fullrange of american technology and talent to improve our ability to intercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries russia should be reassured by the fact that its nuclear arsenal is far too sophisticated and large to be degraded by our missile defenses in addition the welcome agreements on missiledefense cooperation reached in lisbon recently between nato and russia can improve transparency and allow moscow and washington to work together in this field after all north korean or iranian missile is not threat only to the united states but to international stability broadly ratification of the treaty also should not be sold as way to buy moscows cooperation on other issues the men in the kremlin know that loose nukes in the hands of terroristssome who operate in russias unstable southare dangerous that alone should give our governments reason to work together beyond new start and address the threat from tactical nuclear weapons which are smaller and more dispersed and therefore harder to monitor and control russia knows too that nuclear iran in the volatile middle east or the further development of north koreas arsenal is not in its interest russia lives in those neighborhoods that helps explain moscows toughening stance toward tehran and its longstanding concern about pyongyang the issue before the senate is the place of new start in americas future security nuclear weapons will be with us for long time after this treaty our focus must be on stopping dangerous proliferatorsnot on further reductions in the us and russian strategic arsenals which are really no threat to each other or to international stability modern but smaller nuclear arsenal and increasingly sophisticated defenses are the right bases for us nuclear security and that of our allies going forward with the right commitments and understandings ratification of the new start treaty can contribute to this goal if the senate enters those commitments and understandings into the record of ratification new start deserves bipartisan support whether in the lameduck session or next year ms rice professor of political economy at the stanford graduate school of business and senior fellow at stanfords hoover institution was us national security adviser from 2001 to 2005 and us secretary of state from 2005 to 2009,0.7919626832008362
